# Retinas

Inspired by the original Retinas repository, Retinas V2 offers enhanced capabilities for AprilTag tracking and pose estimation using OpenCV.

# Installation

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/GitWyd/RM_Retinas.git

Navigate to the cloned directory:

    cd RM_Retinas

Install the necessary dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Key Features

AprilTag Detection: Provides real-time detection of AprilTags from a webcam feed.
Camera Calibration: Enables calculation of the camera's calibration matrix.
Pose Estimation: Determines the 3D pose of each detected tag relative to the camera using OpenCV's solvePnP.
World Coordinate Transformation: Transforms detected tag poses to a global coordinate system, as defined by particular "world tags".
Visualization: Enhances the video feed by highlighting detected tags, showcasing the tag ID, global pose, and reprojection error.
Reprojection Error Calculation: Computes and showcases reprojection errors for all detected tags.

# Usage

Calibrate Your Camera:

    python src/calibration.py

Once calibration is complete, launch the main application:

    python main.py

# Notes

    The spatial relationships of the predefined world tags are hardcoded into the script. Kindly modify if your world tag setups are different.
